# The most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and seeing the results.

Weâ€™ll train your Deep Reinforcement Learning agent, a lunar lander to land correctly on the Moon using Stable-Baselines3 , a Deep Reinforcement Learning library.

Weâ€™ll upload this trained agent to the Hugging Face Hub, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets, and demos.

So letâ€™s get started! ðŸš€
